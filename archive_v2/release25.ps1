The UI will now aggregate all duplicate worker names into a single row, combining their hashrate, shares, and prioritizing the online status. This perfectly handles scenarios where multiple physical machines share the same worker name or when zombie connections temporarily exist before timing out, ensuring a completely clean and accurate UI."
