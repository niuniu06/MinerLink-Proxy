Drastically increased the ConnectionWriteTimeout and MaxStreamWindowSize in both the Local Tunnel Client and Proxy Server to prevent aggressive TCP teardowns on slow/unstable networks, stopping the 'constantly dropping and reconnecting' loop. Also implemented stable UI sorting: online status first, then alphabetical (A-Z), ensuring the UI list no longer randomly jumps around."
